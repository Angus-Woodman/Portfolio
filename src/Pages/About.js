            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> When I was 16 I got involved in a Greenpower project, where we had to design and build a battery powered go-kart, which we raced at the Goodwood racetrack. This experience fueled my creative passion for technology, and led me down a path towards software development. My ability to continuously work and occasionally lose myself in code assures me that I have made the right decision in pursuing a career in programming. Outside of programming I am a keen sportsman playing lots of golf, cricket, football, tennis and squash and I am also an avid Chelsea fan.</p>

            <p> Throughout my Engineering Mathematics degree I was involved in several projects, where we were tasked with constructing detailed mathematical models, using programming languages Matlab and Python, to solve various real-world problems. This introduction to programming and the satisfaction I experienced from finishing each one of these projects fuelled my desire to pursue a career in programming. After finishing my degree I worked on a robotics project for a real estate consultancy. The company wanted to be able to automate the task of taking multiple photos of the inside of warehouses using a 360o camera. I was tasked with finding the best possible solution and building a prototype, which the team could run tests on. During this project I had to learn fast, dealing with unfamiliar pieces of hardware, such as a Pixhawk and a RasberryPi. The experience gave me valuable problem solving and research skills, which I believe will allow me to hit the ground running when I begin my job. Since then I have completed a Full Stack Web Developer course with Futureproof, which has given me a great base to further develop my programming and web development skills. </p>
